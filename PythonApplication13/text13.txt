The Twisted Logic Tour was a global concert tour by British
 alternative rock band Coldplay in support of their third studio album,
 X&Y (2005). The year-long tour took the band across Europe and their native United Kingdom,
 as well as to the United States and Canada. The main legs of the tour concluded in July 2006 after shows
 in Asia & Australia, with the band resting for a lengthy period of time, and beginning production of their fourth
 studio album Viva La Vida or Death and All His Friends in November. In the beginning of 2007, a final leg in Latin America concluded
 the tour entirely in March, after about a dozen shows. Pollstar reported that the 2005 North American leg grossed an estimated $24.1 million.
 The second leg of the North American tour ended 6 April 2006 at the Wachovia Center in Philadelphia.
